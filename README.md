# Reading for Gender Bias

***Promote gender equality by identifying potential gender bias in letters of recommendation and evaluations***
***Autocorrect for bias***

Implicit gender bias in evaluations negatively impacts women at every stage of their career. The goal of this project is to create a web-based text analysis tool that scans and reveals language bias associated with evaluations and letters of recommendation written for trainees and applicants. Bringing awareness to the existence of implicit bias may impact how evaluations for women are drafted and judged, thereby providing a concrete way to tackle gender disparities.

## Welcome!

## What is the project about?

### The problem

* Gender disparities exist in medicine, science, business, and many other careers
* Letters of recommendation and evaluations written for women differ in key ways from letters written for men
* The differences impact everything from how women are graded in a class to whether they are hired or promoted 
* Most writers (men and women) are unaware of gender bias in their writing 

So, even if someone wants to write a really strong letter for a women, they will probably include language that reflects [implicit bias][link_implicitbias], which weakens the letter.

### The solution

Reading for Gender Bias is a web-based text analysis tool that:

* Scans evaluations or letters and reveals language associated with bias
* Summarizes changes that would reduce bias
* Increases awareness of gender bias
