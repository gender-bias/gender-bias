# Reading for Gender Bias

***Promote gender equality by identifying potential gender bias in letters of recommendation and evaluations***

***Autocorrect for bias***

Implicit gender bias in evaluations negatively impacts women at every stage of her career. The goal of this project is to create a web-based text analysis tool that scans and reveals language bias associated with evaluations and letters of recommendation written for trainees and applicants.  The tool will provide a summary of potential changes to the writer to help them remove bias.  The hope is that by bringing awareness to the existence of implicit bias, we can change how evaluations for women are drafted and judged, thereby providing a concrete way to tackle gender disparities.

## Welcome! 

Thank you for visiting the Reading for Gender Bias project!

This document (the README file) introduces you to the project.  Feel free to explore by section or just scroll through.

## What is the project about?

### The problem

* Gender disparities exist in medicine, science, business, and many other professions
* Letters of recommendation and evaluations written for women differ in key ways from letters written for men
* The differences impact everything from how women are graded in a class to whether they are hired or promoted 
* Most writers (men and women) are unaware of gender bias in their writing 

So, even if someone wants to write a really strong letter for a woman, they will probably include language that reflects [implicit bias][link_implicitbias], which weakens the letter.

### The solution

Reading for Gender Bias is a web-based text analysis tool that:

* Scans evaluations or letters for language associated with bias
* Summarizes changes that would reduce bias for the writer
* Increases awareness of gender bias

## About the founder

[Mollie][link_Mollie] is a medical student and a future neuroscientist who would like to make the world a better place.

The development of this project is mentored by [Jason][link_Jason] as part of [Mozilla Open Leaders][link_mozilla] and started in 2018.

## How can you get involved?

So glad you asked!  WooHoo!

Help in any way you can!

We need expertise in coding, web design, program development, documentation, and technical writing.  We're using Python for the text analysis. I've created issues around different rules/signals to search for in letters.  Example letters can be found [here](https://github.com/molliem/gender-bias/tree/master/example_letters).

If you think you can help in any of these areas or in an area I haven't thought of yet, please check out our [contributors' guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) and our [roadmap](https://github.com/molliem/gender-bias/issues/1).

The goal of this project is to promote gender equity, so we want to maintain a positive and supportive environment for everyone who wants to participate.  Please follow the [Mozilla Community Participation Guidelines](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/participation/) in all interactions on and offline.  Thanks!

Studies on gender bias show that letters/evaluations written for women are:

* Less likely to mention [publications, projects, and research](#publications-projects-and-research) 
* Less likely to include [superlatives](#superlatives) ('She was the best, the top, the greatest')
* Less likely to use [nouns](#nouns) ('He was a researcher' while 'she taught')
* More likely to include [minimal assurance](#minimal-assurance) ('She can do the job') rather than a strong endorsement
* More likely to highlight [effort](#effort) ('She is hard-working') instead of highlighting accomplishments ('her research')
* More likely to discuss [personal life](#personal-life) and fail to use formal titles
* More likely to include [gender stereotypes](#gender-stereotypes) ('She is compassionate' while 'he is a leader') and emotion-focused words 
* More likely to [raise doubt](#raise-doubt) 
* [Shorter](#shorter)
